A3EAI 0.4.3 Alpha

Files changed:
A3EAI.pbo
A3EAI_config.sqf

[ADDED] AI uniform classnames can now be defined on a per-level basis.
[ADDED] AI headgear classnames can now be defined on a per-level basis.

Important: The upcoming Epoch 0.3.0 update will most likely break A3EAI's dynamic classname functions. If this happens, A3EAI will use the classnames defined in A3EAI_config.sqf instead and should continue running normally. A follow-up update will be made to adapt these functions to Epoch 0.3.0's new loot table structure.
