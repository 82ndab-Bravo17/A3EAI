NEW INSTALL PROCEDURE REQUIRED!

IMPORTANT: If you already have A3EAI installed (before version 0.2.0), you must remove all A3EAI files from @EpochHive.

To install A3XAI:

1. Copy @A3EAI from "1. Installation Package" into your server's Arma 3 directory.
2. Modify your server's startup parameters to include @A3XAI. For example: -serverMod=@EpochHive;@A3XAI;

To configure A3XAI:

1. Unpack A3XAI_config.A3EAI (Recommended to use PBO Manager: http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=16369)
2. Edit config.cpp with a text editor (Recommended to use Notepad++: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). Make your configuration changes.
3. Repack A3XAI_config.A3EAI
